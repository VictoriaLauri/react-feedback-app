# Feedback App (using React.js)

## Description

This is a react.js project - an app that allows users to add, update and delete feedback with rating. It uses a mock REST API with json-server.

## Concepts covered

This project utilised most of the React fundamentals, including:

- Components
- JSX
- Props (which I have created and then swapped for imports from context and {useContext} hook)
- State (both global and component level) and {useState} hook
- {useEffect} hook
- Context and {useContext} hook to avoid prop drilling
- Handling events
- Lists and Keys
- Forms
- Mock backend using json-server
- using concurrently npm package to run frontend and backend server with a single command
- Context API
- HTTP requests
